### Conclusion
<div style="text-align: justify"> The most important factor that affects movie rating is the duration. The longer the movie is, 
the higher the rating will be. The number of faces in movie poster has a negative impact on the
movie rating. Instead, focusing and marketing the genre of the movie especially like Biography,
Documentary or Crime would prove more beneficial.Having higher budget for a movie doesn’t
necessarily guarantee higher ratings. Therefore, for a given limited budget, it is worth investing
in a popular and credible director rather than a famous actor.Studios should encourage more critics to
review their movies to help with the ratings. </div>
